                    and a passionate Web Developer and Machine Learning Researcher.
                    It is my goal to grow my knowledge in both fields to help the
                    community and solve large-scale world problems.</p>

                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>I started learning Java in my sophomore year of highschool. I mastered skills in 
                        object-oriented programming, and I also learned different algorithms and data
                        structures taking this course. I don't use much Java in the real-world applications
                        but I always resort to the language when solving problems on LeetCode.

                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>I learned basic python syntax and graphics functions starting my freshman year 
                        of highschool. Eventually, I taught myself more advanced Python during the beginning
                        of my sophomore year in highschool. I retranslate LeetCode problems I solved in Java to Python.

                    <h2>Web Development</h2>
                    <p>I became motivated to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the summer after my sophomore year.
                        I decided to become a self-driven web developer and voluneteered to help others and my
                        community in improving and redesigning their websites to improve online marketing and profit.
                        I am currently improving my skills in Flask and Django.

                    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>I developed an interest in machine learning around the beginning of my junior year. I learned
                        the foundations of neural networks and data processing after attending IDTech's Aritifical Intelligence
                        summer program. I was able to develop my own convolutional neural network that was efficient in
                        diagnosing lung cancer, and I was invited to present my model in Princeton University in front of 
                        chair members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>Throughout my web development journey, I learned to become profficient in visual design and aesthetics.
                        I primarily use Canva and Figma when creating visual graphics for online advertisements or even
                        websites. I also utilize Tableau to reorganize data I collect so their impact is emphasized in a 
                        new manner.

                    <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
                    <p>I'm a great collaborator and public speaker. I held a math tutoring job for 2 years where I helped kids
                        of all ages in improving their mathematical and critical thinking skills. Afterwards, I decided to 
                        switch to private tutoring online where I teach other kids that even reside in other states.
